Useful for downloading certain types of files on mobile using the `Download link` feature when they do not want to allow saving normally. For example, downloading an HTML file on mobile instead of it rendering as a webpage can be quite difficult.

### [Text Repeater](https://kuuuube.github.io/text-repeater)

## Japanese Tools
