# Kuuube's RSI Notes

This is a collection of tips that have helped me through dealing with RSIs (Repetitive Strain Injuries) over 5+ years.

## Finding Neutral Wrist Angle

1. Place your forearm flat on a table.
2. Make a loose fist with your thumb to the side (not under your hand)

This is roughly where your wrist is at a neutral angle. Note that the top of your knuckles are above your wrist.

## Steel Balls (Baoding Balls)

Steel ball exercises are one of the most effective methods for warming up and strengthening the hands.

It involves manipulating two steel balls in the hands in various ways. Some examples:

- Holding two balls with your palm facing upwards, rotate the balls towards (left: ↻ | right: ↺) and away from your body (left: ↺ | right: ↻) using only your fingers.

    This is the easiest exercise. You should not need to move your wrist or arm to help do this.

- Face your palm sideways or upside down and repeat the above exercise.

    This may be very hard at first. Especially when rotating away from your body (↺|↻). Aim to not "cheat" by tilting your hands around.

- Any variation of these at any angle. You can increase the number of balls to three, four, or as many as you can fit in your hand. But be mindful to keep the angle of your wrist close to neutral.

I recommend buying 1.5-2" (3.8-5cm) AISI 52100 chrome steel balls to start out. You may also find these referred to as "chrome steel bearing balls". It is important to note that chrome steel is NOT chrome plated steel.

You should be able to buy the absolute cheapest ones you can find. Tight tolerances are not a concern. I bought mine here [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPSC6B46](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPSC6B46).

To verify you have actually received steel balls and not a cheaper metal or hollow balls, check against the following chart (you may get slightly different numbers but it should be somewhat close):

| Diameter      | Weight |
|---------------|--------|
| 1.5" (3.81cm) | 226g   |
| 1.75" (4.4cm) | 359g   |
| 2 (5cm)       | 536g   |
| 2.5" (6.35cm) | 1047g  |
| 3" (7.6cm)    | 1809g  |

Although I only mention steel balls, these are available in all sorts of materials such as wood, stone, gemstone, or glass. You may also find balls intended for meditation or spiritual uses, I only use and can only endorse their effectiveness as a physical tool.

## Extensor Bands

Many exercises (such as the steel ball ones above) train the muscles that close the hand. But it is also good to train the opposing muscles that open the hand.

Doing so is rather simple with some bands. Some extensor bands have finger holes and some don't, they both work just fine.

The most simple exercise you can do with these is opening your hand about halfway while all your fingers are in the band and the band is placed close to your fingertips. If you go too far, the band may slip down your fingers and the resistance decreases the closer you get to your hand being fully open so there's no need to go too far.

Personally I use a set of bands from Grip Genie [https://gripgenie.com/products/extensor-bands](https://gripgenie.com/products/extensor-bands). Beware that these bands are quite strong, if your hands are very weak you probably shouldn't buy these.
