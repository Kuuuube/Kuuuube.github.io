# Discord Fonts

My personal Discord theme for setting fonts. Base fonts are pulled from this repo. Some fonts are large and need to be installed locally

## Japanese Fonts

### Hiragino

MacOS default Japanese fonts. I cannot link these here due to copyright issues.

### Jigmo

A collection of fonts covering an enormous amount of CJK unicode. Prefers Japanese glyphs over Chinese so it can be used as a primary Japanese font but personally, I use it as a fallback.

Download and install all three Jigmo fonts (`Jigmo1`, `Jigmo2`, `Jigmo3`): https://kamichikoichi.github.io/jigmo/

### Babelstone Han

A primarily Chinese font that also contains some rare Japanese characters. This font should only be used as a fallback and not as a primary font for Japanese.

Scroll to the very bottom and download where it says `Current version: BabelStoneHan-x.x.x.zip (xxxx-xx-xx)`: https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Fonts/Han.html.
